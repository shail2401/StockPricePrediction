# Project Overview**
The Stock Price Predictor explores the use of machine learning to predict stock prices, leveraging historical stock data to forecast future values.

## Objective
This project aims to predict future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTMs, a recurrent neural network (RNN), are well-suited for time series data, such as stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock prices and trading volumes to forecast future closing prices.

## Methodology
## Model Used: 
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network.

## Tools
* Keras for model building, with TensorFlow as the backend.
* Data: Historical stock prices and trading volumes.

## Achievements
* Developed a predictive model using LSTM networks.
* Achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.00093063, indicating high accuracy.

## Key Learnings
* Application of deep learning techniques with LSTM networks.
* Utilization of Keras and TensorFlow libraries.
* Data collection, preprocessing, and model performance analysis.
* Optimization of neural network parameters for better results.
